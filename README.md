# Rails Tutor Tutorials

My personalized Rails learning journey, powered by the [rails-tutor](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire) skill.

Each tutorial is tailored to my background, uses real code examples from the Campfire codebase, and tracks my understanding through quizzes with spaced repetition.

## Structure

- `learner_profile.md` - My background, goals, and learning context
- `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md` - Individual tutorials with Q&A and quiz history

## Progress

Tutorials are created as I learn, with understanding scores updated through quizzes. The spaced repetition system ensures concepts stick long-term.
