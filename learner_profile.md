**Q1. What's your background with programming and Rails? Have you built things before, followed tutorials, or is this relatively new territory?**

**Answer.** I started programming back in college, but I didn't really grasp it. So, even though I did courses in my college degree about programming using loops and stuff in C, C++, and all, I wanted to make web apps and didn't know how to do it. JavaScript felt too overwhelming, so I skipped it and pursued a career in a non-technical field until 2023 when ChatGPT came out.

That's when I also learned about Ruby on Rails, and it was everything that I wanted as an entrepreneurial person. The vision of DHH really resonated with me, so I decided to teach myself programming while building a SaaS product - Curated Connections (https://curatedconnections.io/) with my brother. But we realise that we have massive knowledge gaps because we followed an unconventional path to move fast in the product (which is now doing >$1000 MRR).

I feel I really want to level up my Rails knowledge and become a top programmer now. Because we did a lot of vibe coding so even basic concepts aren't really clear to me.

**Q2. This is your private AI tutor whose goal is to make you a top 1% programmer. Where do you want this to take you? A million-dollar product? Getting hired at a company you admire? Something else entirely?**

**Answer.** I just want to become the best programmer ever. I realize that I've created a product and I want to take it to new heights. But also, I want to be like DHH or a senior member of 37signals team essentially. I think with AI, I can get there in record time. Being able to grasp this project that they created and opensourced will be a great way to do that. 

My goal is to learn not just the basics of Ruby on Rails using this project, but also the advanced stuff that they use in this project, along with the conventions and the softer Rails development skills that you can learn by looking at how DHH and his team are building and thinking about various different approaches to doing something here.

**Q3. Tell me a bit about yourself - imagine we just met at a coworking space. What's your story beyond the programming journey?**

**Answer.** I am a software creator who is trying to build a SAAS business to become financially independent. I taught myself Rails using ChatGPT and continue to heavily build with AI today (using tools like Claude Code) while also focusing on levelling myself up in the process.

**Q4. When you've tried to learn programming concepts before (whether from docs, tutorials, or ChatGPT), what made something actually stick versus go in one ear and out the other?**

**Answer.** I would say that it's when two things happened. One is that when the learning was happening in service of a feature that I could see or that I wanted to build in a product. Second is when it was able to connect, the lesson was able to connect to the broader, holistic picture of web development and why the concept was so important in the first place. What problem it solved? What people did before this and how it simplified their flows?

I like to basically look at any concept from the lens of what problem did it solve rather than simply how it works or even how I can make it work. It's a third level. And ofcourse, clever light humour sprinkled here and there always helps keep things interesting.
