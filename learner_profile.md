**Q1. What's your background with programming and Rails? Have you built anything before, followed tutorials, or is this completely new territory?**

**Answer.** I actually built this app myself after teaching myself Ruby on Rails using ChatGPT in 2023 when ChatGPT came out. I built this app with my brother, who is my co-founder, and we decided to build a SaaS application. This app generates a thousand dollars plus of monthly recurring revenue, but it's sort of vibe coded, and I want to deepen my knowledge because there are massive knowledge gaps in my understanding of Rails and even the fundamentals, not to mention the advanced stuff.

**Q2. This is your private AI tutor whose goal is to make you a top 1% programmer. Where do you want this to take you? What does success look like - scaling this product to much bigger numbers, building more products, getting hired somewhere you admire, or something else entirely?**

**Answer.** I definitely want to scale this to bigger numbers. I'm a big fan of DHH, and I really want to deepen my knowledge, go from vibe coding to be an actual Rails expert, somebody who DHH would love to hire at 37signals. Not because I want to work at 37signals, but because I want to be of that caliber, like a senior developer at 37signals. I really believe that I can get there in a very, very short amount of time because I have Claude as my tutor.

**Q3. Tell me a bit about yourself - imagine we just met at a coworking space. What's your background, what drives you, what's your life like outside of building this SaaS?**

**Answer.** I'm a really ambitious person. I care about financial independence, so I've wanted to be an entrepreneur for a long time, but just couldn't get into programming because none of the frameworks like JavaScript frameworks really stuck with me. I tried them when I was in college, but I couldn't get myself to understand anything, and it felt even too daunting to begin because there was like a new thing that I need to understand, like 10 things that I need to learn to get going.

It wasn't until ChatGPT came out and AI came out, and that was also the time around which I learned about Ruby on Rails, the amazing framework DHH created as a one-person framework that can do everything. That's when I rekindled my old dream of becoming a software entrepreneur, and I think I wanna make like everybody saying that AI can lead to a billion dollar opportunity, like AI like the world of AI will give you the first billion dollar company created by one or two people. I think I can beat that, so that's where I want to go maybe.

I also feel like understanding, even in the world of AI, having a deep technical expertise is important. AI intelligence is good, but using AI to level up human intelligence is even more powerful. I really really believe that. I don't want to offload my thinking to AI, I want to be in control of it.

## Teaching Notes

**Learning context:** Self-taught via AI assistance, has a working $1k+ MRR SaaS but with foundational gaps. "Vibe coded" the app - it works but understanding is patchy.

**Goal:** DHH-caliber Rails developer. Wants to understand the "why" not just the "how". Aspires to be someone 37signals would hire.

**Motivation style:** Highly ambitious, driven by financial independence and the dream of building a billion-dollar one-person company. Believes deeply in AI-augmented human intelligence.

**Key insight:** Does NOT want to offload thinking to AI. Wants to genuinely understand and be in control. Tutorials should build deep mental models, not just show code to copy.

**What resonates:** Rails as "one-person framework", DHH philosophy, escaping JavaScript framework fatigue, simplicity and elegance.
