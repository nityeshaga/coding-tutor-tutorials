**Q1. What's your background with programming and Rails? Have you built anything before, followed tutorials, worked professionally with code?**

**Answer.** I started programming back in college, but I didn't really grasp it. So, even though I did courses in my college degree about programming using loops and stuff in C, C++, and all, I wanted to make web apps and didn't know how to do it. JavaScript felt too overwhelming, so I skipped it and pursued a career in a non-technical field until 2023 when ChatGPT came out.

That's when I also learned about Ruby on Rails, and it was everything that I wanted as an entrepreneurial person. The vision of DHH really resonated with me, so I decided to teach myself programming.

I feel I really want to level up my Rails knowledge and become a top programmer now. Because we did a lot of vibe coding so even basic concepts aren't really clear to me.

**Q2. This is your private AI tutor whose goal is to make you a top 1% programmer. Where do you want this to take you? What does success look like?**

**Answer.** I just want to become the best programmer ever. I realize that I've created a product and I want to take it to new heights. But also, I want to be like DHH essentially. I look at his keynotes and the stuff that he or even his teammates at 37signals are working on, and I'm nowhere close to that. I think with AI, I can get there in record time.

**Q3. Tell me a bit about yourself - imagine we just met at a coworking space.**

**Answer.** I am a software dev enthusiast who is trying to build a SAAS business to become financially independent.

## Teaching Notes

**Starting point:** Has shipped real product with AI assistance but lacks foundational understanding. "Vibe coded" - meaning pattern-matched without mental models.

**Aspiration:** DHH-level mastery. Not just building products but deep craft.

**Learning style to explore:** Entrepreneurial, practical, resonates with DHH's philosophy. Likely learns best when concepts connect to real product problems.

**Key opportunity:** Already has a production codebase and paying customers - can teach through the lens of "here's what's actually happening in YOUR code."
