**Q1. What's your background with programming?**

**Answer:** Self-taught using ChatGPT starting in 2023. Started programming in college (C, C++) but didn't grasp it - JavaScript felt overwhelming. Discovered Ruby on Rails through DHH's vision, which resonated deeply as an entrepreneurial person. Built Curated Connections (https://curatedconnections.io/), a SaaS product, with his brother - both learned Rails through building it. The product is now doing >$1000 MRR. Has practical experience shipping a real product but acknowledges massive gaps in foundational knowledge due to the unconventional "vibe coding" path. Curious about other frameworks like Next.js but strongly prefers Rails ("Rails pilled").

**Commentary:** This is the ideal learner profile - someone who has *shipped* before diving into theory. He has working intuition about what Rails can do, but likely learned patterns without understanding why they exist. The gaps he senses are probably around: how Rails magic actually works under the hood, when to break conventions, performance implications of choices, and the broader web development landscape beyond Rails.

**Q2. Where do you want this to take you?**

**Answer:** Wants to be a top-tier entrepreneur-programmer - "the best programmer ever." Already running Curated Connections at ~$1k MRR and wants to take it to new heights. Goal is to become a "T-shaped" expert: deep expertise in Rails, but broad understanding of the entire landscape of tools and frameworks. Aspires to be like DHH or a senior member of the 37signals team. Wants to understand what to use when - not just a Rails developer, but someone who can expertly build anything. Believes AI can help get there in record time.

**Commentary:** The T-shaped goal is perfect for structuring learning. We should go deep on Rails internals and patterns, but periodically zoom out to compare with other ecosystems (Next.js, Django, etc.) so he understands trade-offs. The entrepreneurial context means we should emphasize practical patterns that ship fast AND scale, not academic purity. Learning from 37signals' open-source projects is an excellent approach.

**Q3. Tell me about yourself - imagine we just met at a coworking space.**

**Answer:** A software creator trying to build a SaaS business to become financially independent. Takes pride in using AI effectively to build things (currently using Claude Code). Believes that to use AI well for coding, you need genuine technical capability - you can't "vibe code to greatness." References Elon Musk's point about tech CEOs needing to be technical to guide their teams. Taught himself Rails using ChatGPT and continues to heavily build with AI while focusing on leveling up in the process.

**Commentary:** This is a thoughtful, deliberate learner. He's not looking for quick tips - he wants mental models. Tutorials should start with the problem a feature solves, show what life looked like before it existed, then reveal how it works. Analogies and "why this design decision" explanations will land well. He'll appreciate when I connect Rails patterns to broader programming concepts.

**Q4. What makes programming concepts actually stick?**

**Answer:** Two things make learning stick:
1. When learning happens in service of a feature he can see or wants to build
2. When the lesson connects to the broader, holistic picture of web development - why the concept is important, what problem it solved, what people did before it existed

Prefers understanding the "why" before the "how" - wants to know why something was created and what it looks like in different scenarios before diving into mechanics. This is a "third level" beyond just how it works or how to make it work. Light humor sprinkled in helps keep things interesting.

## Teaching Approach Notes

- **Start with "why"**: Always ground concepts in the problem they solve
- **Compare ecosystems**: When relevant, show how Next.js/Django/etc. solve the same problem differently
- **Entrepreneurial lens**: Emphasize patterns that are both fast to ship and maintainable at scale
- **AI-aware**: He uses AI to code - teach him to spot when AI gives subtly wrong patterns
- **Real code anchoring**: Use his actual codebase (form-flow, Curated Connections if available) for examples
- **Build mental models**: Diagrams, analogies, the "shape" of concepts - not just syntax
- **Feature-driven**: Connect concepts to features he wants to build
- **Light humor**: Keep things engaging with clever, light humor
